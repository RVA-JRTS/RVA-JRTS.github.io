We are happy you are here! Both groups are designed to support you and others through open discussion with slight differences in format. While James River Transgender Society - *JRTS for short* - is topic driven, Let's Talk is an open forum. In both cases, participants are encouraged to share their knowledge, ask questions, and support each other no matter where they land on the gender spectrum or how far they are in their journeys. We hope you are looking forward to sharing your story, and find meaning and benefit by participating!
