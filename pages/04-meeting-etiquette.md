JRTS and Let's Talk encourage open, fair, and safe conversations about a wide variety of topics related to our journeys and the transgender community. There are, hoverever, some guidelines to help ensure discussions remain respectful. Participants are expected to avoid detailed conversations about the following topics:
- Political viewpoints, campaigns, and candidates
- Promoting religious doctrine
- Sexually explicit activities, kinks, and preferences
- Descriptive drug use, solicitation, or other illegal activities
- Prescription drug dosages
- Professional medical advice
- Other group participants without their prior consent

**Please respect other members; no conversations should be repeated outside the meeting space. Thank you**
